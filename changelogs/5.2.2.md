## Changes
* Account placeholder now properly supports PAPI
  * Allows for the following flags under "impactor:account"
    * "currency=(namespace)/(value)" - Specifies the particular currency we wish to evaluate
    * "balance" - Shows the balance of the account, based on the selected currency (otherwise, defaults to primary currency)
    * "name" - Reveals the name of the account holder

## Fixes
* Account placeholder now correctly resolves under all circumstances
