## Changes
* Fabric - Impactor now forwards placeholders to PlaceholderAPI on startup. This allows plugins using that api to start using Impactor placeholders without special support.
  * NOTE: Due to complexity, some placeholders designed for Impactor may not parse properly via PAPI with the context available.
